         "description":"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just above shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting back with your hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

         "description":"To get yourself into the starting position, set the pulleys at the floor level (lowest level possible on the machine that is below your torso).Place an incline bench (set at 45 degrees) in between the pulleys, select a weight on each one and grab a pulley on each hand.With a handle on each hand, lie on the incline bench and bring your hands together at arms length in front of your face. This will be your starting position.With a slight bend of your elbows (in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon), lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary. The movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and exhale. Hold the contracted position for a second. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",
